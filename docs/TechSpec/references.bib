  abstract = {We introduce a length-based, age-structured model, MULTIFAN-CL, that provides an integrated method of estimating catch age composition, growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment, and other parameters from time series of fishery catch, effort, and length frequency data. The method incorporates Bayesian parameter estimation, estimation of confidence intervals for model parameters, and procedures for hypothesis testing to assist model development. We apply the method to South Pacific albacore, Thunnus alalunga, fishery data and demonstrate the incorporation of model structure such as spatial heterogeneity, age-dependent natural mortality and movement rates, time series trends and seasonal variation in catchability, and density-dependent growth. Consistency of the results of the albacore analysis with various exogenous sets of biological and environmental data gives credence to the model results.},

  abstract = {The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

  abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters               b               (exponent) and                                M                 u                              (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters               b               =-0.288 (90\% CL[-0.315, -0.261]) and                                M                 u                              =3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year               -1               . Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about               b               =-0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year               -1               ) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year               -1               ), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

  abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

  abstract = {Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing datalimited fish stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the fisheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

  abstract = {SCHNUTEJ, 1981. A versatile growth model with statistically stable parameters. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 38: 1128- 1140. This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleratisrt. Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gsmpertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier fomulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},
